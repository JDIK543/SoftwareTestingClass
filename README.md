# SoftwareTestingClass
 
The included files are assignments/test suites from my Software Testing class

Amalgamator was a file given to us by the professor, it was our job to build the test suite and find issues/bugs. Over the course of a few classes the professor would make "fixes" and add functionality and we would have to update the test suite.

Bowling is an assignment focused on test driven development. The included png is the specifications/ruleset of the program. We were to first develop groups of testcases, develop the program until testcases pass, and then restart the process.
